# pnpm-sync

## Background

This repository shows a proof-of-concept implementation of the "pnpm-sync" command that is proposed in the Rush [Subspaces RFC #4230](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues/4230).<br>
The PNPM package manager installs "injected" dependencies by copying the build output of a local workspace project into one or more symlinked node_modules subfolders. Today PNPM performs this copying only once during the initial "pnpm install", but that is not a complete solution; the output should really be copied whenever the project is rebuilt. The proposed `pnpm-sync` command provides a way to perform this copying after a workspace project is compiled (before its consumers are compiled). The operation is optimized by precomputing the source/target folder locations and storing this information in a new file (`<your-library>/node_modules/.pnpm-sync.json`). In our implementation, `pnpm-sync prepare` writes that JSON file, and `pnpm-sync` reads the JSON file and performs the copy.

### Next steps:

This repo was created to facilitate discussion about the design of the `pnpm-sync` command.
Our next step will be to fully implement this feature in the [RushJS](https://rushjs.io) tool (as part of the upcoming "subspaces" feature).
If that is successful, we will then propose to integrate the `pnpm-sync` functionality directly into the official PNPM package manager.
